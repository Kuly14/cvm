## Identity function

This precompiled contract performs the identity function. In mathematics, an identity function is a function that always returns the same value as its argument. In this context, the contract takes the input data and returns it as is. This precompiled contract resides at the hardcoded Ethereum address `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000004`.

The `identity_run` function takes two arguments: input data, which it returns unaltered, and `energy_limit` which defines the maximum computational work the function is allowed to do. A linear energy cost calculation based on the size of the input data and two constants, `IDENTITY_BASE` (the base cost of the operation) and `IDENTITY_PER_WORD` (the cost per word), is performed. If the calculated energy cost exceeds the `energy_limit`, an `Error::OutOfEnergy` is returned.

This identity function can be useful in various scenarios such as forwarding data or acting as a data validation check within a contract. Despite its simplicity, it contributes to the flexibility and broad utility of the Ethereum platform.
